This is the github for my biochemistry tool
scripts.  In an undergraduate biochemistry class
we are asked to solve various problems like
net charge at a pH, isoelectric point, order
or elution in various exchange resins and in
this folder, I will write programs to automate
this process.  

Currently I have a script that can solve for the net
charge.

ALL OF THE PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE THE PROTEIN.TXT
